# Read Me

This is the first portfolio site I have ever made. Since I left college I have never needed it. With times
being hard it's time I really show what I can do. This project is just the beginning. I am using some of todays most mordern libraries and frameworks to showcase that I am constantly learning, adapting, and adding my own creative touches. I hope you enjoy and if you do I will see you at the interview.
